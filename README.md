# Chennai-House-Price-Prediction
Real estate transactions are quite opaque sometimes and it may be  difficult for a newbie to know the fair price of any given home.  Thus, multiple real estate websites have the functionality to predict the prices of houses given different features regarding it. Such forecasting models will help buyers to identify a fair price for the home and also give insights to sellers as to how to build  homes that fetch them more money. It is expected to build a sale price prediction model that will aid the customers to find a fair price for their homes  and also help the sellers understand what factors are fetching more money for the houses.
